    <string name="help_desc_text">Every round there will be two cards displayed on the screen. Each card will have 3 themed pictures displayed on it.
        The cards will have some pictures in common with each other. Your task is to find which pictures are shared between the two cards and you must
        do so in the least time possible. You can choose a theme for the pictures through the options menu. Choose the superheroes theme for a lower difficulty
        and the patterns theme for a more challenging game.
