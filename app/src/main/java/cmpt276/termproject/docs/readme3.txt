# iSpy - Spot it Game

A match card game with two themes which include Superheroes or LogoGang. User can also
select words + image game play mode, so that user can match a word + image that are related,
instead of just matching images. An option to use Flickr is also given, so that user
can choose images they want used for their game. There are also different draw pile sizes for each order
for higher difficulty. The selected options will save between runs. Cards will automatically
initialize the theme, images(from Flickr), or game play mode chosen and shuffled before playing.
Win by matching the correct picture or word(if word + image game play is chosen) in record time.
When the game is over  the on touch feature will pop up a screen allowing you to view
your score and save or continue. The user can view high scores to beat and save their own scores
to make it to the top 5; they can view or reset the scores before or after playing the game. Each order
and draw pile size will have different default scores to beat. Help screen explains the rules and
conventions of the game in detail with sources provided.
