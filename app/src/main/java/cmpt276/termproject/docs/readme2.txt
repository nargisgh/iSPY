# iSpy - Spot it Game

A match card game with two themes which include Superheroes or Logos. User can also
select words + image game play mode, so that user can match a word + image that are related,
instead of just matching images. An option to use Flickr is also given, so that user
can choose images they want used for their game. There are also different draw pile sizes
for higher difficulty. The selected options will save between runs. Cards will automatically
initialize the theme, images(from Flickr), or game play mode chosen and shuffle before game play.
Win by matching the correct picture in record time. When the game is over  the on touch feature will
pop up a screen allowing  you to view your score and save or continue. The user can view high scores
to beat and save their own scores to make it to the top 5; they can view or reset the scores before
or after playing the game. High scores will be shown based on order and draw pile size user selected.
Help screen explains the rules and conventions of the game in detail with sources provided.
