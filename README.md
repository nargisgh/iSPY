# iSPY
Android Java app developed with Agile processes, completed in 3 iterations with Scrum roles including Scrum Master and Product Owner. What it Does: Inspired by Spot It, iSpy will display two stacks of cards with a number of pictures on each card at the beginning of each game. There is always exactly one image that matches between all the cards; you need to match the image from the newly drawn card to the card in the discard pile. Multiple themes available to use for the card deck. If you want to switch up the images, you can choose your own from searching the Flickr API or import from your photo gallery to save/edit those options. More challenging features include enabling matching images and their corresponding text, match text-to-text, or mixed, with options between easy/medium/hard for rotated and different sized image sets! Another way to challenge yourself is having the freedom of choosing deck size and order in the options menu. New features also includes exporting the deck on your own device so you can practice or print. Fastest score will get you at the top of the high scores screen.
